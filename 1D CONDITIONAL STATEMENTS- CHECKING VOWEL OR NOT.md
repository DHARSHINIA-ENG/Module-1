## Experiment No: 1d â€“ Conditional Statements- Checking

## AIM  
To Write a Python program to print the account balance after withdrawal.
savingsbalance=5000
## ALGORITHM  
1. Start
2. Set savingAmt = 5000

4. Calculate bal = savingAmt - withdrawAmt
5. If withdrawAmt > 5000, then:Print "Insufficient balance"
6. Else:Print "Account Balance:" followed by bal
7. End

## PROGRAM
