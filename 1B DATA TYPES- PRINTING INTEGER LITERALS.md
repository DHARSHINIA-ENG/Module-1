# Experiment No: 1B- Data Types â€“ Printing Float Literals

## AIM  
To write a python program to read and print two float values..

## ALGORITHM  
1. Begin the program.  
2. Get float1 and float2 value from the user 
3. Use the `print()` function to display the float numbers.  
4. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```python
float1=float(input())
float2=float(input())
print(float1,float2)

```
