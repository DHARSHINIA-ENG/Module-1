# Experiment No: 1c-Varibles and Expressions, Operators - Comparing two numbers

## AIM
To Write a python program to compare the following two values using all the relational operators(>,<,>=,<=,== ,!=)
a = 13
b = 33

## ALGORITHM
1. Begin the program.
2. Initialize variable a with value 13.
3. Initialize variable b with value 33.
4. Compare if a is greater than b. Print the result (True or False).
5. Compare if a is less than b. Print the result.
6. Compare if a is greater than or equal to b. Print the result.
7. Compare if a is less than or equal to b. Print the result.
8. Compare if a is equal to b. Print the result.
9. Compare if a is not equal to b. Print the result.
10. End

## PROGRAM
```python
a=13
b=33
print(a>b)
print(a<b)
print(a>=b)
print(a<=b)
print(a==b)
print(a!=b)
```
